        <p>
          We interviewed Joshua Ryan-Saha who is one of the co-founders' of Traveltech, who provided valuable advice on creating a social and localized tool that stands out among existing tourist apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Insights: He gave us background on tourism and how people in general plan their activities. He told us that planning a trip involves 5 stages: dreaming, planning, booking, experiencing, and sharing. The advice was that we had to decide what part of the process our device would intervene with. We decided that our app was helpful for the planning and experiencing stages.
