        <h3>CubeScrub: A Cartesian Robot for Cleaning Flat Surfaces</h3>
        <p>
          CubeScrub is a Cartesian robot designed to move along three axes (X, Y, Z) to effectively clean flat surfaces. Below is a detailed overview of its development, from concept to implementation.

          <h4>CubeScrub: Previous Work and Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            CubeScrub was inspired by existing Cartesian robot systems and automated cleaning devices. The goal was to design a modular, efficient, and user-friendly cleaning robot that could be intuitively controlled while maintaining stability and flexibility for various cleaning tasks.

          <h4>CubeScrub: Design Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout the development of CubeScrub, we explored three main design iterations. Each brought unique insights and challenges. Below is a summary of the designs, their advantages, and their limitations. 
            After careful evaluation, we decided to proceed with Iteration 2 due to its balance of simplicity, stability, and functionality.

        <h2>Reflection and Personal Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this process, I gained invaluable experience in executing a project from the design phase to wiring, testing, and showcasing a fully functioning machine. I developed practical skills in assembling objects, including learning to use drills and screwdrivers to construct the box with aluminum extruders. Additionally, I mastered mechanisms such as belts and pulleys, as well as gear racks and pinions, by integrating them into the system for three-directional movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I utilized a flexible ball joint, which I designed and 3D-printed, for the cleaning arm to ensure flexibility during operation. I also learned to synchronize stepper motors and continuous servo motors, enabling smooth and coordinated movements within the system. My proficiency in CAD and 3D modeling grew significantly as I designed and printed custom components, such as the plate holders for the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I expanded my fabrication skills by using a laser cutter to precisely cut wooden and aluminum pieces for the belt and pulley systems. I also laser-cut the platform that supports the bowls and plates during operation. Lastly, I designed and assembled the controller box, ensuring that the entire system was user-friendly and intuitive. This hands-on project allowed me to bridge the gap between design and practical implementation, equipping me with essential technical and collaborative skills for future endeavors.
