        <h3>CubeScrub: A Cartesian Robot for Cleaning Flat Surfaces</h3>
        <p>
          CubeScrub is a Cartesian robot designed to move along three axes (X, Y, Z) to effectively clean flat surfaces. Below is a detailed overview of its development, from concept to implementation.

          <h4>CubeScrub: Previous Work and Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            CubeScrub was inspired by existing Cartesian robot systems and automated cleaning devices. The goal was to design a modular, efficient, and user-friendly cleaning robot that could be intuitively controlled while maintaining stability and flexibility for various cleaning tasks.

          <h4>CubeScrub: Design Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout the development of CubeScrub, we explored three main design iterations. Each brought unique insights and challenges. Below is a summary of the designs, their advantages, and their limitations. 
            After careful evaluation, we decided to proceed with Iteration 2 due to its balance of simplicity, stability, and functionality.
