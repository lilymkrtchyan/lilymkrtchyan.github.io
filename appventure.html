      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>Ithaca Soap needed a mobile experience that translated their core values—natural ingredients, sustainability, and education—into a user-friendly app. The site had to speak to eco-conscious consumers who wanted ingredient transparency, clear usage guides, and incentives to return.</p>

      <h2>Journey & Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User & Client Interviews:</strong> We spoke with the founder Wendy and conducted 4 detailed interviews with users of varying demographics and digital fluency.</li>
        <li><strong>Personas & Task Flows:</strong> Created personas based on motivations like budget-saving, sensitive skin, and scent preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Sketching & Wireframing:</strong> We developed the core pages—Home, Products, Product Detail, Rewards, FAQ—with responsive, intuitive layout plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative User Testing:</strong> Users tested our early prototype; we implemented suggestions like a "Sensitive Skin" filter, usage tips, and mobile bottom nav bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Built the full app in Vue.js with JSON fixtures for products. We followed mobile app UI best practices like cards, bottom nav, and scrollable bundles.</li>
      </ul>
