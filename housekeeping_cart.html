    <h2>Prototyping the Robotic Cart</h2>
    <p>We progressively prototyped the cart by retrofitting an off-the-shelf system with hoverboard components. Here's a look into our iterative process:</p>

      <div class="prototype-item">

  <section class="section-container">
    <h2>How We Built It</h2>
    <p>Once we selected the hoverboard as our power base, we disassembled it and engineered a custom electronics stack that allowed us to control the motors and test behaviors under load. Here's how we made it work:</p>
  
    <ul class="build-steps">
      <li><strong>Disassembly:</strong> We removed the hoverboard’s original plastic housing and took out its proprietary control board to access the motors and sensors.</li>
      <li><strong>Motor Control Setup:</strong> The brushless motors with rotary encoders were rewired to connect to an <em>ODrive</em> motor controller for high-precision motion control.</li>
      <li><strong>Processing Logic:</strong> A <em>Raspberry Pi</em> was configured to send commands to the ODrive and handle encoder feedback and tuning.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor Repurposing:</strong> We reused the original pressure sensors (from the footpads) to simulate user input and verify motor actuation under different triggers.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> After verifying all connections, we tested the response time, speed, and control fidelity before integrating it with the cart.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      This hardware stack gave us full low-level control over the hoverboard wheels and opened possibilities for adding position control, obstacle sensing, and user overrides in future iterations.

    <h2>Reflections, Feedback & Constraints</h2>
  
    <h3>Personal Reflections</h3>
    <p>
      This project pushed me to bridge mechanical design with electronics integration in a fast-paced, iterative environment. I learned how to reverse-engineer existing systems, work with unfamiliar hardware like hoverboards and ODrive controllers, and test in unpredictable, real-world conditions. Beyond the technical work, I gained confidence in collaborative prototyping, troubleshooting, and decision-making under uncertainty.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Professional Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      During our presentation at the final design showcase, industry professionals and faculty appreciated the project’s ambition to retrofit a commercially available cart instead of building from scratch. Several highlighted our decision to keep the system modular and adaptable to a wide range of hotel environments. We also received praise for maintaining user-centered thinking throughout, especially in how we handled ergonomic concerns and hallway obstructions.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Technical Constraints</h3>
    <ul class="constraint-list">
      <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Our portable power source needed to deliver consistent current without overheating the motor controllers during prolonged use.</li>
      <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> The hoverboard motors were not designed to carry a fully loaded cart with uneven weight — we had to reinforce the base and balance payloads carefully.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> Repurposing footpad pressure sensors required custom calibration and sometimes inconsistent trigger sensitivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Real-Time Control:</strong> Controlling the motors via Raspberry Pi and ODrive introduced slight delays when reading encoder data at high frequency.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Fit:</strong> Mounting the drive base to the cart involved drilling and zip-tying in tight spaces, which complicated maintenance and repositioning.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      While we didn’t have time to implement full autonomy or remote steering, this project served as a meaningful step toward smarter assistive tools in the hospitality industry — blending engineering with empathy and practicality.
