      <h2>Telegram LiveChat: Case Study</h2>
      <p>
        Telegram LiveChat is a feature designed to enable real-time transparency and interaction in conversations by showing what the other user is typing in real time. It combines innovation with user research to create a feature that addresses the lack of personalization and transparency in traditional messaging apps.

          During the research phase, we identified two primary challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The lack of self-expression and personalization features in messaging apps.</li>
          <li>The lack of transparency between users during conversations.</li>

          To decide which solutions to prioritize, we used an impact-effort matrix to evaluate feasibility and potential impact. This process helped us focus on high-impact and feasible solutions, like LiveChat.

    <h3>Why Live Chat is the Optimal Choice</h3>
    <p>
      In our journey to innovate Telegram's messaging experience, we evaluated three potential features — 
      <strong>Emoji Moodboard</strong>, <strong>Telegram Stories</strong>, and <strong>Live Chat</strong>. 
      After an in-depth analysis and prototyping process, we chose to proceed with Live Chat as the feature 
      that most effectively addresses user needs and sets Telegram apart in the competitive messaging landscape.

    <div class="feature-highlights">
      <div class="highlight-card">
        <h4>Addressing User Pain Points</h4>
        <p><strong>Texting-induced anxiety:</strong> Many users experience stress from typing indicators ("bubbles") and the ambiguity of waiting for a response or deleted messages.</p>
        <p><strong>Lack of engagement:</strong> Users desire a more dynamic and interactive way to communicate, resembling in-person interactions.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="highlight-card">
        <h4>Differentiation from Competitors</h4>
        <p>Live Chat redefines messaging by enabling users to see what the other person is typing in real time, offering a unique communication experience that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alleviates texting-induced anxiety by showing the flow of thoughts during messaging.</li>
          <li>Engages users in a completely new way.</li>

    <h3>Questions Considered</h3>
    <p>
      During the development of Telegram Live Chat, we carefully examined the following critical questions to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience:
    </p>
    <ul class="questions-list">
      <li>How would the other user’s typing look like?</li>
      <li>How would my, as the user’s, typing look like?</li>
      <li>How to indicate that the message is complete?</li>
      <li>How to turn on and off the feature button would look like?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section class="project-section live-chat-activation">
    <h3>How Would Activating the Live Chat Look Like?</h3>
    <p>
      The route: <strong>Menu → Settings → Chat Settings → Live Chat (On)</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="activation-gallery">
      <img src="images/activation.webp" alt="Live Chat Activation" class="activation-image">
    </div>
    <p>
      The Live Chat activation switch would be within the settings as it is related to other settings of the chat within the information hierarchy. 
      The user would switch the Live Chat switch from “off” condition to “On” condition. The switch looks and functions identical to all the other buttons related to 
      similar settings within the information hierarchy, hence there should be no confusion as to how to use it.

        <h4>VERSION 1:</h4>
        <p>
          In this version we, the user, type <strong>Ok</strong> as the other user is typing their message. 
          This is a very unique function of this message, as the user — we — can see/reply to the other user’s message even if that message is yet incomplete. 
          In this variation of typing we explore the visual appearance of our typing box. Namely, unlike the typing box of the other user, the typing box for us, as the user, 
          is not changed from the original Telegram feature (when Live Chat is off).

        <h4>VERSION 2:</h4>
        <p>
          In the second variation of the visual exploration of the typing box, we explore the typing box that looks identical to what the other user is seeing 
          (typing in process).

      <h4>THE CHOICE:</h4>
      <p>
        I think that the second version of the typing box is more suitable for the feature as it displays exactly how the user on the other side of the conversation 
        would see the typing. It avoids the confusion that may occur with the traditional typing box and it shows the typing user exactly what the other person is seeing.

    <h3>What Would Indicate That The Message Is Complete?</h3>
    <div class="message-complete-container">
      <div class="message-complete-text">
        <p>
          In the original Telegram messaging, there are two ticks, one indicating that the message is delivered, and the second one indicating that the message was read. 
          This, however, would not work for the Live Chat as the user might read half of the message only (if they see the message in the process) and not see all of it. 
          There also needs to be a clarification of when the message is complete so the user knows that the thought is complete and that they can reply to a complete message. 
          For these two reasons, I have designed a message layout that lights up when the message is complete (when the user presses enter). 
          The Enter key in the traditional Telegram messaging sends the message to the chat, however, in the Live Chat it completes the message.
