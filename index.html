        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Armenia—a small country in the Near East that many people have never heard of. Before leaving Armenia, I never imagined that being a descendant of genocide survivors or witnessing a war that spanned my entire life would define me in the eyes of others. Yet, when that's all the international media mentions about Armenians, it's no surprise that people around the world associate my identity with these traumas. While these events have undeniably shaped me, they do not define the entirety of who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          The turning point in my life was being accepted to United World College Dilijan, my international high school. I moved from mandatory military camps—where we learned to march, shoot, and assemble guns—to a school for future leaders, a place dedicated to peacebuilding and uniting nations through education. UWC Dilijan's mission, "to make education a force to unite nations, people, and cultures for peace and a sustainable future," became the foundation of my worldview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying alongside peers from more than 80 countries broadened my perspective on the world's social, economic, and political challenges. It gave me the tools to construct a narrative about Armenians—and myself—that went beyond trauma. UWC taught me to see differences not as divisions but as opportunities to learn, grow, and celebrate the richness of our diverse world.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 17, I left home to attend UWC; at 19, I moved across continents to attend Cornell University on a full-ride scholarship. The combination of the Davis United World College Scholarship and Cornell's Foreign Students Scholarship has been life-changing. Yet, adapting to life in the U.S. hasn't been easy. I remember standing at the airport security line, struggling to decide whether to bring my favorite Armenian chocolates or an extra pair of shoes. Upon arrival, I had to do tasks I'd never done before—in a language I barely understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living at an international boarding school at a young age taught me to navigate cultural differences with openness and respect. I learned from my peers' experiences and approached unfamiliar customs with curiosity. I'll never forget conversations about shared living expectations with roommates from cultures where knocking on doors wasn't customary, or the etiquette lessons from my English teacher, who explained why we should accept papers with both hands in her culture. Observing these nuances—from the way people peel mandarins to how they approach food, dating, and marriage—gave me a deeper appreciation for humanity's incredible diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being Armenian in the global world is both "weird" and "unsettling." How do I explain that saying, "I want to eat your liver," expresses love and affection, or that I air-dry my clothes wherever I can? How do I explain my confusion over coffee options when I've only ever drunk Armenian coffee? But it's also "different," "fresh," and "innovative." These quirks have sparked my curiosity about societal norms and inspired me to approach technology design with fresh eyes—challenging the status quo while embracing diversity.
