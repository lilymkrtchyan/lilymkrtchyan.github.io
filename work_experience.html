        <p>
          During my time with the <strong>Armenian National Institute</strong> and the <strong>Armenian Assembly of America</strong>, 
          I contributed to several impactful projects focused on documenting and preserving Armenian history and heritage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conducted extensive research on the Armenian Genocide and the conflict in Artsakh, contributing to the documentation 
            and preservation of critical historical narratives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Played a key role in archiving historical documents and updating archives related to the Armenian Genocide and the 
            Lachin Corridor blockade. This included work on 
            <a href="https://www.armenian-genocide.org/nagorno-karabakh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              documenting and archiving files relating to the war over the Artsakh region and the blockade of the Lachin Corridor.
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Assisted in the development of a new website for the <strong>Armenian National Institute</strong>, 
            ensuring accessibility to comprehensive resources for researchers, educators, and the general public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborated with teams in both Washington, D.C., and Yerevan, Armenia, highlighting my adaptability 
            and commitment to cross-cultural teamwork.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This experience deepened my understanding of historical preservation, policy research, and advocacy, 
          while fostering my skills in collaboration, organization, and attention to detail.
